Sudoku Solver

This Python module can solve even 'hard' sudoku problems almost instantly. It takes
longer to input the board, then it does to solve the problem.  It would probably benefit
from either a problem generator, or a gui interface for input.

__How to use__

import solver
import boards

b = solver.SudokuBoard(board.board_hard)
s = solver.Solver(b)
s.run()


To solve a different problem, pass in the board you want to solve to the constrcutor
of SudokuBoard.  The board should be a list of 9 lists of length 9. Each entry 
represents a square on the board. Use 0 for blanks.

See boards.py for example boards.
